# Greetings
Hello! Welcome to my new, WIP portfolio website. Here you'll find explorations of graphics, animation, math, music, and art in the context of game development, as well as anything else that I find interesting. I unfortunately am a graphics programmer and not a web developer though, so please bear with the lack of visual interest and stark bright backgrounds of this website as I become acquanted with this new system.
