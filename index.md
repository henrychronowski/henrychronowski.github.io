# Greetings
Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! Here you'll find explorations of graphics, animation, math, music, and art in the context of game development, as well as anything else that I find interesting. Unfortunately even though I am a graphics programmer I am definitely not a web developer so I may not keep this site very pretty, but I hope to provide some interesting explorations despite this.
