## Overview

You play as a lone fire mage living in a remote snowy tundra. You were heading home one night and a blizzard caught you off guard. Through the thick snow cover you are unable to see the sinkhole ahead of you and are thrown from your sled and into the darkness below. Make your way through the ruins of the past and get home before you freeze. You must be careful though, your abilities drain your body heat and there is only so much warmth to go around.
