## Overview

SpyDer is a puzzle-platformer in which the player uses a grappling hook to infiltrate an enemy base and steal vital documentation. The player must use their wit and skill to solve puzzles, avoid lasers, and stay out of the view of cameras. This was my first fully remote project, and as a team we worked through many technical and production challenges to achieve our goals.

## Development Environment

- Unity
