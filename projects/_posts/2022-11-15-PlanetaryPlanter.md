## Overview

    Planetary Planter is a single-player, open-world, third-person farming game where, instead of farming normal vegetables, you grow celestial bodies while exploring an alien world. You explore the alien world using exploration tools to find seeds and modifiers scattered throughout the environments. After planting and growing planets and stars you can harvest them. Once the planets and stars are harvested, the player can arrange them into solar systems, and arrange those solar systems into constellations. Players completing these constellations results in them receiving new exploration tools to help them explore as well as getting more of the story unlocked to read. This was my final capstone game which I joined midway through development after Unga Bunga. [It's out on Steam now!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1974080/Planetary_Planter/)

## Development Environment

- Unity 2021.1.19f1
- Clip Studio Paint for 2D art

## Personal Contributions

   I worked as the graphics and animation programmer on this project, helping to architect a unique scriptable rendering pipeline built off of the HDRP for Unity in order to help realize the comfortable and interesting environment needed for Planetary Planter. In addition to my pipeline work, I also built multiple parts of the environment ranging from the customizable and procedural skybox to 2D asset creation for objects and VFX including the grass to help take the load off of environment artists. By far my favorite task on the project was developing an efficient way to use vertex displacement in this customized pipeline to emulate a spherical world to replace the fully modelled round world with custom physics that existed when I joined the team.
