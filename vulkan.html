                    <p class="lead mt-4"><strong>Overview</strong>
                        <br> This is a project that I am actively working on with <a href="http://www.ethanheil.com/VulkanRenderer.html">Ethan Heil</a> with the dual goals of learning the Vulkan API and improving my skills and knowledge of graphics programming. At this stage the renderer loads a textured 3D model and displays it. From here we are going to continue to add standard graphical features while exploring the Vulkan API.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4"><strong>Personal Contribution</strong>
                        <br>    I personally have focused primarily on the 3D aspects of the renderer so far, having integrated the texture and model loading as well as set up the depth pass and buffer. Having attempted to write a file parser for 3D object files I elected to make
                                        use of a couple common libraries for this application, utilizing <a href="https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader.git">tinyobjloader</a> for parsing .obj and .mtl files and
                        <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/af1a5bc352164740c1cc1354942b1c6b72eacb8a/stb_image.h">stb_image</a> for texture parsing. Although these have made focusing on the actual graphics engineering side significantly easier I would like to revisit this at a later date and build custom parsers for the renderer.
                        Once I figured out how to properly interact with the Vulkan data structures, getting the information from the libraries into the format Vulkan wanted ended up being surprisingly easy.
                        <br> The task which I spent most of the development time on so far was getting the depth buffer functioning, the path to which taught me a great deal about developing with Vulkan. When you hear developers talk about Vulkan and say that you can configure every last
                                        parameter exactly how you want it, you think ok it's configurable. But no; you really can configure every last single parameter and function that you can imagine, and even most of the ones you can't. Whenever I ran into issues developing the depth buffer,
                                        the solution usually ended up being configuring an aspect of a struct that I forgot about, or switching the bitmask's configuration slightly as I had fat-fingered a macro. Very few things have forced upon me the appreciation for every last detail that working in Vulkan has.
                                        After a couple hours of dealing with the issues caused by this though I started to get used to it, and rapidly began to make fewer mistakes and be more accurate and deliberate with my architecture choices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4"><strong>Future Plans</strong>
                        <br> There are definitely several things that I would like to change about the current implementation. For one, the architecture mostly consists of a single large Application class that contains the overwhelming majority of the renderer's functionality,
                                            with some Vulkan data types broken out and encapsulated in smaller classes. This is frankly unweildy and uncomfortable to work with; a 1,400 line long file is never ideal. Moving forward I would like to sit down and reassess the architecture, stepping back
                                            and using UML diagrams or a similar tool to architect out a sensical organization for the renderer that also maintains the decoupling of data. Besides this massive architectural hurdle before moving on to exploring other graphics techniques I would also like to
                                            resolve issues with my implementation of the stencil stored with the depth buffer, as it is currently non-functional. Once these issues are resolved I would like to tackle lighting next, with the eventual goal of implementing reasonably performant global illumination.
