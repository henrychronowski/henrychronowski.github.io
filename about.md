# About

![Headshot](/assets/img/profile/headshot2022.jpg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:300px"}

Hello! I am a game programmer specializing in graphics and animation programming. I work in each part of the pipeline from rendering and shader authoring to VFX, tech art, and animation. I like to go out of my way to build production-ready tools that are extendable and friendly to both engineers and artists. With my Scrum experience I hope to bring workflow and pipeline improvements to each team I work with. Since my recent graduation from Champlain College I have been doing contract work in the game sphere while working towards a permanent position.

When I'm not developing games I try to spend as much time outside as possible, whether that be kayaking, hiking, fishing, or gardening, it helps me to stay sane. I also greatly enjoy playing music, coming from a musical family and having played a variety of instruments as long as I can remember. These days I mostly practice trombone and bass, although I'll play anything I can get my hands on if it means I get to perform.

In whatever spare time I have left I try to maintain my studio, [Earthbreak Games LLC](https://earthbreakgames.com/#/) in a reduced capacity following the publishing of our first project. At this point my goals for the studio are to continue to use my and others knowledge and connections to make publishing on established platforms like the Steam Store accesible for student developers.


I can generally be reached by [email](mailto:hrchronowski@gmail.com), although I am not known to respond rapidly. I also have an up to date copy of a generic resume available [here](https://henrychronowski.com/assets/img/profile/HenryChronowskiResumeS2022.pdf).
