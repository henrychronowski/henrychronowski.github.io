# About

![Headshot](/assets/img/headshot.jpg){:width="300px"}

Hello! I am a graduating Game Programming major at Champlain College focusing in graphics and animation programming. I work in each part of the pipeline from rendering and shader authoring to VFX, tech art, and animation. I like to go out of my way to build production-ready tools that are extendable and friendly to both engineers and artists. With my Scrum experience I hope to bring workflow and pipeline improvements to each team I work with.

When I'm not developing games I try to spend as much time outside as possible, whether that be kayaking, hiking, fishing, or gardening, it helps me to stay sane. I also greatly enjoy playing music, coming from a musical family and having played a variety of instruments as long as I can remember. These days I mostly practice trombone and bass, although I'll play anything I can get my hands on if it means I get to perform.

I am currently leading my studio, [Earthbreak Games LLC](https://earthbreakgames.com/#/) in a reduced capacity following the publishing of our first project. I am trying to use my knowledge and connections to make publishing to established platforms like the Steam Store accesible for student developers, and am in the process of publishing several of my peer's games although Earthbreak does not currently have a project under development itself. That said, upon graduation I am seeking a full time engineering position in the game development industry at a large studio.
